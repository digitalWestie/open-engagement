## Best Practices

### Clear licencing

Tells us what we can do with the data.

- Explain or link to an explanation of Open Data
- Accompany datasets with a summary and a link to the full version of the licence
- Make sure the licence sets out the conditions of attribution, reuse, redistribution and commercialisation


### Access and usability

Help finding and accessing the right data.

- Explain conditions of access to data e.g. any signup requirements, API keys, rate limits etc.
- Document the method of retrieving data e.g. API documentation 
- Allow users to search datasets based on metadata
- Allow users to download extracts from datasets
- Give datasets a unique identifier
- Provide previews of datasets 
- Make the catalogue of datasets with metadata available as a dataset
- State when more recent versions of a dataset are available and provide a link to the latest vesrion


### Be demand driven

Build your data and data publishing programme around the needs of others.

- Take account of all the communities that use or rely on your data
- Find out the needs and resources of your data users
- Be open to suggestions and requests to publish new data
- Structure your publication choices, support, and tools around the your communities' needs and demands


### Provide quality metadata

Metadata also helps usability. Simple bits of information like creation dates can help prospective users understand whether data is suitable.

- Include at a title and a description for each dataset
- Provide meta-data including information about frequency of updates, data formats, and standards adopted
- Indicate chosen date formats
- Provide a creation date for each dataset
- Provide a last-updated date for each dataset
- Report when a dataset has links to other sources
- Provide metadata in a structured format
- Indicate the file format and version or syntax (doctype)
- Indicate the size of downloadable files


### Provide context

Beyond metadata provide the qualitative information about what your data is, where it came from, and how it can be used.

- Provide descriptions of your datasets, e.g. what's contained, how it was gathered, and for what purpose
- Provide information on datasets' origins, especially where they have been derived from other sources
- Explain or link to explanations of domain specific terms
- Explain or link to explanations of identifiers
- Link to published vocabularies and taxonomies
- State where datasets contain errors, uncertainties, or are incomplete
- Where multiple versions of a dataset are available, provide a changelog
- Make previous versions of datasets available
- Link to work produced using the data e.g. reports, analyses, visualisations, etc.


### Support conversation

Build a network and join  Network the people around your data.  

- Accompany datasets with at least one means of contact to the publisher/maintainer
- Provide a way for users to keep informed of updates and new releases e.g. social media account or mailing list
- Keep users informed about new applications of data, both your own and from third parties 
- Provide or join online spaces where users comment on or discuss datasets
- Provide or join offline opportunities to have conversations around your data
- Enable users to rate and/or evaluate datasets


### Build capacity & skills

Help the world do use your data by showing them how.

- Provide examples of reuse cases / applications (fictitious or real) of your data
- Provide or link to guides for working with your data
- Provide or suggest tools for working with your data
- Run workshops on using your data 
- Sponsor or support community capacity building


### Collaborate on data as a common resource

Open Data belongs to all, involve and work with others to make it better.

- Join others in creating / improving data standards
- Provide feedback loops so users can provide suggestions and/or corrections
- Collaborate with the community to create new data resources (e.g. derived datasets)
- Submit your data to projects that aggregate or crowdsource data e.g. wikipedia, wikidata, openstreetmap, etc.
- Submit your data to relevant data portals or sign posting sites
- Actively acknowledge others where you have used their data/services in your own project
- Support those building tools or services that work with your data e.g. open source projects
