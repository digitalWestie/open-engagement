# Achieving Engagement &amp; Impact with Open Data 

This repo started life to host a [checklist of best practices](https://github.com/digitalWestie/open-engagement/blob/master/OE-BEST-PRACTICE.md) when it comes to building engagement around Open Data projects. I hope in time we can all build it out with more best practices, explanations, and examples.
